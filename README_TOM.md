I add two graphs:
+ Graph showing number of Covid19 cases in the US
+ Graph showing number of Covid19 deaths in the US

Two graphs are quite similar but we can easily configured them to be different, we just need to change the data in each graph separately.

The data is retrieved from this API: https://github.com/pomber/covid19

Graph width is set to be 100% so it displays good on mobile
